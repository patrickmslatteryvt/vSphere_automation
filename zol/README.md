ZFS on Linux (ZOL)
==================

NOTE:
I absolutly do not recommend using ZFS as a guest filesystem inside a virtual infrastructure of any type for anything other than test purposes.
ZFS belongs running directly on the hardware at the host OS or hypervisor level.

Purpose:
Project to automate the deployment of a ZFS on Linux VM using CentOS v6.5 for testing purposes.
